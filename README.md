## SecureChat

SecureChat is an ephemeral one-time chat application that ensures complete privacy by making messages disappear once the chat is closed. The application uses sockets to create secure rooms for real-time communication.

## Features

- **Ephemeral Chats:** Messages vanish once the chat is closed, leaving no digital footprint.
- **No Limit on Users:** No limit on users in a single room unless explicitly stated.
- **Password Protection:** Rooms can be secured with passwords.
- **No Data Storage:** Messages are not stored anywhere.
- **Anonymous Chat:** Engage in private conversations without revealing your identity.
- **Location Sharing:** Optionally share your location during a chat.

## How It Works

- **Create a Room:** Choose a unique room ID and a display name. Optionally set a password and room size. Share the details with others to start chatting.
- **Join a Room:** Enter the room ID and your name. Provide the password if the room is protected.
